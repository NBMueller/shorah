It is designed to analyse genetically heterogeneous samples. Its tools\r\nare written in different programming languages and provide error correction,\r\nhaplotype reconstruction and estimation of the frequency of the different\r\ngenetic variants present in a mixed sample.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe software suite ShoRAH (Short Reads Assembly into Haplotypes) consists of\r\nseveral programs, the most imporant of which are:\r\n> `amplian.py`   - amplicon based analysis\r\n\r\n> `dec.py`       - local error correction based on diri_sampler\r\n\r\n> `diri_sampler` - Gibbs sampling for error correction via Dirichlet\r\n>process mixture\r\n\r\n> `contain`      - removal of redundant reads\r\n\r\n> `mm.py`        - maximum matching haplotype construction\r\n\r\n> `freqEst`      - EM algorithm for haplotype frequency\r\n\r\n> `snv.py`       - detects single nucleotide variants, taking strand bias into\r\n>account\r\n\r\n> `shorah.py`    - wrapper for everything\r\n\r\n## Citation\r\nIf you use shorah, please cite the application note paper _Zagordi et al._ on\r\n[BMC Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/119).\r\n\r\n## General usage\r\n\r\n### Dependencies and installation\r\nPlease download and install:\r\n\r\n- [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Download), following the online\r\n  instructions.\r\n- [GNU scientific library GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),\r\n  installation is described in the included README and INSTALL files.\r\n- ncurses is required by samtools. It is usually included in Linux/Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nPlease note that these dependencies can be satisfied also using the package\r\nmanager of many operating system. For example\r\n[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) on Mac OS X,\r\n[yum](http://yum.baseurl.org/) on several linux installations and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nType 'make' to build the C++ programs. This should be enough in most cases. If\r\nyour gsl installation is not standard, you might need to edit the relevant\r\nlines in the `Makefile` (location `/opt/local/` is already included).\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nThe input is a sorted bam file. Analysis can be performed in local or global\r\nmode.\r\n\r\n#### Local analysis\r\n\r\nThe local analysis alone can be run invoking `dec.py` or `amplian.py` (program\r\nfor the amplicon mode). They work by cutting window from the multiple sequence\r\nalignment, invoking `diri_sampler` on the windows and calling `snv.py` for the\r\nSNV calling.\r\n\r\n#### Global analysis\r\n\r\nThe whole global reconstruction consists of the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. error correction (*i.e.* local haplotype reconstruction);\r\n2. SNV calling;\r\n3. removal of redundant reads;\r\n4. global haplotype reconstruction;\r\n5. frequency estimation.\r\n\r\nThese can be run one after the other, or one can invoke `shorah.py`, that runs\r\nthe whole process from bam file to frequency estimation and SNV calling.\r\n","name":"Shorah"}
