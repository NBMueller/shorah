                    <p>ShoRAH is an open source project for the analysis of sequencing data, specifically
                        designed to investigate genetically heterogeneous samples. It is written in Python (with some C++
                        code for performance reasons) and provides error correction, haplotype reconstruction and
                        estimation of the frequency of the different genetic variants present in a mixed sample.</p>

                    <p>ShoRAH 2 is an API breaking update that removes the option to run a <em>global haplotype reconstruction</em>.
                    While this was motivated by the emergence of better tools for this difficult problem, a welcome
                    consequence was the simplification of the codebase (<em>e.g.</em> by removing some Perl legacy
                    code), resulting in a simpler interface and easier development.</p>
